# Article-Spinner-using-Probabilistic-Models
Developed an Article Spinner system leveraging probabilistic models to generate
unique variations of input text. The project involved analyzing transition
probabilities between word triplets in the input text corpus, and selectively
replacing words based on these probabilities to maintain semantic coherence.
By incorporating randomness and probability thresholds, the system effectively
spun articles while preserving meaning and readability.
